![under construction](https://www.greal.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Under_Construction.png)

## About
Basic to-do application created with Vue.js. 
The app will be updated soon, as it currently only has very basic functionality resulting from my brief encounter with Vue. 
This project was part of the CF Full-Stack Web Development course. 

### Planned updates:
- [ ] Local storage for to-dos
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] UI updates (e.g. improvements regarding checkboxes and button placement)
- [ ] Complete styling 
- [ ] Logo, maybe a header
- [ ] New favicon
- [ ] New buttons ('edit' and 'delete' icons)
